### Introduction

This program will enable us to create a file and folder tree by making a sequence of at least 5 commits. It will also include a well-defined ticketing system that shows the tasks performed. It will be written in Python.

1 - Creation of our Github repository

After creation we should have the following files:

- LICENCE file containing the clauses governing use of the project
- .gitignore file that lets you ignore files and ensure that certain files/directories are not included in the history
- README file (the one in which we write) which will allow us to document the programme

Despite this principal files previously quoted, we have to create a repository with the following tree structure :

In our case all this precedure will be done automatically by excuting a python file where we have all the function that will allow us to create the repository. This file named "Principal.py" we can found it in the directory "src".
