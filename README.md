### Introduction

This program will enable us to create a file and folder tree by making a sequence of at least 5 commits. It will also include a well-defined ticketing system that shows the tasks performed. It will be written in Python.

1 - Creation of our Github repository

After creation we should have the following files:

- LICENCE file containing the clauses governing use of the project
- .gitignore file that lets you ignore files and ensure that certain files/directories are not included in the history
- README file (the one in which we write) which will allow us to document the programme

Despite this principal files previously quoted, we have to create a repository with the following tree structure :

In our case all this precedure will be done automatically by excuting a python file where we have all the function that will allow us to create the repository. This file named "Principal.py" we can found it in the directory "src".

2 - Automation server

To simplify our job we creat an automation server which allow us to excute some task. This has been done by creating the file main.yml located in the directory .github/workflows.

In the Actions fields we can see all the job done by the server :
